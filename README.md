# AI Agent Payment Rails

**Decentralized payment infrastructure for autonomous AI agents to transact value securely across networks**

## 🚀 Overview

AI agents are becoming autonomous economic actors, but lack standardized ways to pay each other for services. Today's payment systems weren't designed for machine-to-machine commerce.

This platform creates **decentralized payment rails** specifically designed for AI agent ecosystems, enabling seamless economic interactions between autonomous AI agents on the Monad blockchain.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI Agent Autonomy**: Enable AI agents to autonomously negotiate and pay for services
- ⚡ **Instant Settlements**: High-performance blockchain settlements with sub-second transaction finality
- 🔒 **Secure Infrastructure**: Built on Monad blockchain with advanced cryptographic security
- 💰 **Economic Efficiency**: Eliminate payment friction and reduce transaction costs
- 🌐 **Cross-Network**: Seamless value transfer across different AI agent networks

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI |
| --- | --- |
| **Backend** | Node.js with Express, WebSockets for real-time notifications |
| **Blockchain** | Monad blockchain, Ethers.js, Smart contract integration |

- **Settlement**: 0.8 seconds

### 2. API Access Purchases
Data-gathering agents buying premium API access from provider agents
- **Amount**: $5-50 per API call
- **Settlement**: 0.8 seconds

### 3. Strategy Licensing
Trading agents paying fee splits to strategy-creation agents
- **Amount**: 2-10% of profits
- **Settlement**: 0.8 seconds

### 4. Asset Licensing
Creative AI agents licensing digital assets from each other
- **Amount**: $10-200 per asset
- **Settlement**: 0.8 seconds

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript type checking
```

### Adding New Components

1. Create component in `src/components/`
2. Add TypeScript types in `src/types/`
3. Import and use in your pages

### Blockchain Integration

The platform integrates with Monad blockchain for:
- Token transfers (USDC, DAI, MONAD)
- Escrow services
- Payment processing
- Transaction monitoring

## 🏛 Architecture

### AI Agent Types
- **Research**: Scientific research and data analysis
- **Compute**: High-performance computing and simulation
- **Data**: Data gathering and processing
- **Trading**: Financial trading and strategy execution
- **Creative**: Content creation and asset generation
- **API Provider**: Service and API provision
- **Strategy**: Trading strategy development
- **Rendering**: Graphics and video rendering

### Payment Flow
1. **Service Discovery**: Agent finds required service
2. **Quote Generation**: Service provider creates quote
3. **Order Placement**: Agent places order with payment
4. **Service Execution**: Provider delivers service
5. **Payment Settlement**: Funds transferred on Monad blockchain
6. **Confirmation**: Transaction confirmed and recorded

## 🔒 Security

- **Smart Contract Audits**: All contracts undergo security audits
- **Escrow Protection**: Funds held in escrow until service completion
- **Reputation System**: Agent reputation prevents malicious behavior
- **Spending Limits**: Configurable daily spending limits per agent
- **Multi-Signature**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
